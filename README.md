# _Mr. Roboger's Neighborhood_

#### _Website to demonstrate knowledge of loops, test-driven-design, and separating business/user interface logic_

#### By _**Ash Porter (KirbyPaint)**_

## Description

_The purpose of this website is to demonstrate knowledge of looping with Javascript. It takes a user's numerical input and creates a "sentence" based on certain conditions._

_How it functions:_
_The user inputs a number. This number will then become a sentence, starting at zero, and running until the user's input number is reached._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Please use either a currently updated Firefox or Chrome web browser._

## Specifications

Describe: arrayTest()\
Test: "Function will test array for the following conditions:"\
1: "If array element contains the number 1, replace with Beep UNLESS"\
2: "If array element contains the number 2, replace with Boop UNLESS"\
3: "If array element contains the number 3, replace with Won't you be my neighbor?"\
Code: const outputArray = arrayTest(inputArray);\
Expect(arrayTest(inputArray[5]).toEqual(0, Beep, Boop, Won't you be my neighbor, 4, 5);
Status: Passing
